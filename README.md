# React Apps for SOCCCD (with TS)
This repo provides a production ready starting point for modern react apps development using new React, TypeScript and many more developer tooling.

Boilerplate is scaffolded using `fb/cra with` `cra-template-rb` template. Learn the more about [template](./Boilerplate.md)

## Prerequisite.
- VS code
- Install all recommended extensions
- Windows terminal (ubuntu preferred, otherwise powershell)
- Do not use default CMD
- Node LTS or 16+
- Some prior knowledge of TypeScript, Unit testing and JavaScripting :)

## Getting started (simple way)
- Familiarize yourself with all scripts in `package.json`'s `script:{}` section. Get to know what CLI commands are available. E.g, `yarn start`
- Familiarize yourself with all packages used in this repo. That means literally going through each package's github repo or npm page. Head over to `package.json`'s `dependencies` list, press CTRL key then hover on a package name to get the package's homepage link.
